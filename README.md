# Mission_to_Mars

The purpose of this challenge was to learn how to scrape data from the web using Chrome Developer Tools, BeautifulSoup and Splinter.

I successfully created a Jupyter Notebook file that you can watch the process play out.  I also, created a VS Code file that runs the same program, with some minor tweeks, that creates a web page showing the information nicely organized.

This challenge was not without its obstactals.  I was able to get the Jupyter file to run fine, but the VS Code, did not do so well.  I could not figure out why I kept getting "hemisphere not defined" error.  I worked with my tutor, who helped me find my spelling mistakes.  She tweeked some of the code.  When we finally got the program to run we found another spelling mistake in one of the titles.  It was corrected.

I conclusion, this challenge was fun.  I enjoyed the experience.
